Install From Binaries
=====================

    We provide precompiled binary packages for various operating
systems. The user is recommended to use these packages when possible.

    For systems which a precomplied binary is unavailable, the user may
install STEPS following the steps in the Basic Installation section.


Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. Before the installation:
     1.1 Make sure you have Python and a c++ compiler installed in your system.
     1.2 If you've installed STEPS with version below 1.1.0, please remove the
         binaries before any installation.
         By default, it is installed in
         /usr/local/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages/steps
         /usr/local/lib/libsteps*
         Please also remove any "stepsredirect.pth" file in your system.
         
  2. Download the source code package from STEPS website.
     The package name should be similar to the following:
                     STEPS-x.x.x.tar.gz
     where x.x.x is the version number of the package.
  
  3. 'cd' to the directory containing the source code package. Unpack the package,
     e.g. in Mac/Linux, type
                tar -xvzf STEPS-x.x.x.tar.gz
     The source code will be unpacked in folder "STEPS-x.x.x".
                
  4. 'cd' to the unpacked folder
                cd STEPS-x.x.x

  5. Build the binaries from source code (general).
                python setup.py build
 
    5.1. For MinGW in Windows, replace the general command with
                python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
                
    5.2. For Cygwin in Windows, replace the general command with
                python setup.py build --compiler=cygwin

  6. Install the binary package.
                [sudo] python setup.py install

Example:
    $ cd ~/Downlaods
    $ tar -xvzf STEPS-1.1.0.tar.gz
    $ cd STEPS-1.1.0
    $ python setup.py build
    $ [sudo] python setup.py install
