Release Notes

Version 1.0.0 (2010-01-05)
=============
First release.

Version 1.0.1 (2010-01-28)
=============
1. Bug fix of utilities.meshio.importTetgen() method crashing.
2. Changes to 'def' classes so that these classes no longer store a pointer to model level objects or access data from those objects, instead coping all data during construction and setup. Also modified rng.py to be directly created by swig for compatability with python3.
