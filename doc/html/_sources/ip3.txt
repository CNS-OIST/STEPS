*********************************************
Example: Surface-Volume Reactions (IP3 Model)
*********************************************

In :doc:`/well_mixed` we use objects of type :class:`steps.model.Reac` to represent
a reaction taking place inside a volume. In this chapter we consider another 
type of kinetic reaction represented by the :class:`steps.model.SReac` class 
(associated with the :class:`steps.model.Surfsys` container) which defines a 
reaction taking place on a surface (patch) which separates two compartments 
(arbitrarily naming one of them the “inner” compartment, and the other one 
the “outer” compartment). Reactants and products can then be freely moving 
around in a compartment adjoined to the patch or embedded in the surface. 
Therefore, it is necessary to firstly specify the location of the reactant 
and product species [#f1]_.
   
The stoichiometry of the surface reaction is specified by the following lists:

* Species on the left hand side of the reaction (the reactants):
    * Species on the surface (``slhs``).
    * Species in the “outer” compartment (``olhs``).
    * or Species in the “inner” compartment (``ilhs``) [#f2]_.

* Species on the right hand side of the reaction (the reactants):
    * Species on the surface (``srhs``).
    * Species in the “outer” compartment (``orhs``).
    * or Species in the “inner” compartment (``irhs``).
    
To become familiar with these objects we will build a simplified version of 
the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP :math:`_{3}`) model
:ref:`Figure 3.1 <figure_3_1>` (described in [#f3]_) in STEPS.
:ref:`Figure 3.2 <figure_3_2>` provides the schematic diagram of the states 
and transitions in the model. We see that our reactions take place on the 
membrane between the cytosol and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and therefore 
must be described by an SReac object, with each “binding” reaction described 
by a second order surface reaction and each “unbinding” reaction by a first 
order surface reaction.

   In the IP3 receptor model, reactions (i.e. receptor binding of IP3 and 
   calcium molecules) take place on the membrane separating the endoplasmic 
   reticulum (ER) and the cytosol. Therefore, we will use Surface Reaction 
   objects to describe the reactions.

   transitions in the IP :math:`_{\text{3}}` receptor model.
   
We will go through the Python code to build this model in STEPS, 
but providing only brief descriptions of operations we are familiar 
with from the previous chapter. 

Model specification
===================

First we need to import the :mod:`steps.model` package and create a **Model** 
container object named mdl, as we did in section::
    
    >>> import steps.model as smodel
    >>> mdl = smodel.Model()
    
Now we create the species in this model based on :ref:`Figure 3.2 <figure_3_2>`, 
declaring all receptor states as separate Spec objects. Recall that all 
identifier strings must be unique and we should also make sure not to reuse 
a variable name so that we do not lose any references to the objects we create::

    >>> # Calcium
    >>> Ca = smodel.Spec('Ca', mdl)
    >>>
    >>> # IP3
    >>> IP3 = smodel.Spec('IP3', mdl)
    >>>
    >>> ############### receptor state objects ###############
    >>> # receptor state: 'naive' state (no bound ligands)
    >>> R = smodel.Spec('R', mdl)
    >>> 
    >>> # receptor state: bound IP3 
    >>> RIP3 = smodel.Spec('RIP3', mdl)
    >>> 
    >>> # receptor state: bound IP3 and Ca (open)
    >>> Ropen = smodel.Spec('Ropen', mdl)
    >>>
    >>> # receptor state: Ca bound to one inactivation site
    >>> RCa = smodel.Spec('RCa', mdl)
    >>>
    >>> # receptor state: Ca bound to two inactivation sites
    >>> R2Ca = smodel.Spec('R2Ca', mdl)
    >>>
    >>> # receptor state: Ca bound to three inactivation sites
    >>> R3Ca = smodel.Spec('R3Ca', mdl)
    >>> 
    >>> # receptor state: Ca bound to four inactivation sites
    >>> R4Ca = smodel.Spec('R4Ca', mdl)
    >>> #######################################################

Next we create a *surface system*. The function of a surface system is similar 
to the volume system used to group Reac objects in :doc:`/well_mixed`. Basically, 
surface systems group a set of stoichiometric reaction rules that are described 
by **SReac** objects. It is often the case that such reactions are modeled as 
taking place on a membrane surface and not within a volume, although this is 
actually not a necessity. We need to create an object of type
:class:`steps.model.Surfsys`. The arguments to the class constructor are an identifier 
string and a reference to the parent **Model** object::

    >>> surfsys = smodel.Surfsys('ssys', mdl)
    
Now it is time to specify the reaction stoichiometry, defined in 
:ref:`Figure 3.2 <figure_3_2>`. Unlike the model in :doc:`/well_mixed`, 
reactions in this model are defined by the surface reaction objects 
(:class:`steps.model.SReac`) in which the arguments include information about 
which compartment or patch the reactants and products belong to. 
At this stage we must chose which compartment we will label 'outer' 
and which we will label 'inner' and make sure to maintain this labelling 
throughout our definitions, and also in our geometry description. 
We chose to label the cytosol as the 'outer' compartment and the ER 
as the 'inner' compartment. 

We will first complete all “forward” binding reactions, recalling that 
“forward” and “backward” reactions must be declared separately::

    >>> # The 'forward' binding reactions:
    >>> 
    >>> R_bind_IP3_f = smodel.SReac('R_bind_IP3_f', surfsys, \
            olhs=[IP3], slhs=[R], srhs=[RIP3])

    >>> RIP3_bind_Ca_f = smodel.SReac('RIP3_bind_Ca_f', surfsys, \
            olhs=[Ca], slhs=[RIP3], srhs = [Ropen])

    >>> R_bind_Ca_f = smodel.SReac('R_bind_Ca_f', surfsys, \
            olhs=[Ca], slhs=[R], srhs=[RCa])
    >>>
    >>> RCa_bind_Ca_f = smodel.SReac('RCa_bind_Ca_f', surfsys, \
            olhs=[Ca], slhs=[RCa],srhs = [R2Ca])
    >>>
    >>> R2Ca_bind_Ca_f = smodel.SReac('R2Ca_bind_Ca_f', surfsys, \
            olhs=[Ca], slhs= [R2Ca], srhs = [R3Ca])
    >>>
    >>> R3Ca_bind_Ca_f = smodel.SReac('R3Ca_bind_ca_f', surfsys, \
            olhs=[Ca], slhs=[R3Ca], srhs=[R4Ca])

The backslash used here merely allows us to continue our statement 
on the next line and is used to make the code more readable.

Now for the “backward” unbinding reactions::

    >>> # The 'backward' unbinding reactions:
    >>>
    >>> R_bind_IP3_b = smodel.SReac('R_bind_IP3_b', surfsys, \
            slhs=[RIP3], orhs=[IP3], srhs=[R])
    >>>
    >>> RIP3_bind_Ca_b = smodel.SReac('RIP3_bind_Ca_b', surfsys, \
            slhs=[Ropen], orhs=[Ca], srhs=[RIP3])
    >>>
    >>> R_bind_Ca_b = smodel.SReac('R_bind_Ca_b', surfsys, \
            slhs=[RCa], orhs=[Ca], srhs=[R])
    >>>
    >>> RCa_bind_Ca_b = smodel.SReac('RCa_bind_Ca_b', surfsys, \
            slhs=[R2Ca], orhs=[Ca], srhs=[RCa])
    >>>
    >>> R2Ca_bind_Ca_b = smodel.SReac('R2Ca_bind_Ca_b', surfsys, \
            slhs=[R3Ca], orhs=[Ca], srhs= [R2Ca])
    >>>
    >>> R3Ca_bind_Ca_b = smodel.SReac('R3Ca_bind_ca_b', surfsys, \
            slhs=[R4Ca], orhs=[Ca], srhs=[R3Ca])
            
We model our calcium flux from the ER to the cytosol as a second order reaction. 
In effect we are saying, when such a reaction takes place, a calcium ion from 
the ER passes instantaneously through an open receptor to the cytosol.

::

    >>> # Ca ions passing through open IP3R channel
    >>> R_Ca_channel_f = smodel.SReac('R_Ca_channel_f', surfsys, \
            ilhs=[Ca], slhs=[Ropen], orhs=[Ca], srhs=[Ropen])
            
We can see that it is vital that when we come to describing our geometry 
that our compartment labelling is maintained. At this level we have specified 
whether some reactants and products belong to the 'inner' or 'outer' compartment, 
with the intention to label the cytosol as the 'outer' compartment and the ER as 
the 'inner' compartment, but we will not actually make that distinction until 
we come to describing our geometry.

Next, we set all reaction constants' default values (see [#f3]_). These constants 
could have been passed to the initializer when we were creating our SReac objects,
but for clarity we chose to set them here with method ``setKcst``. We must make 
sure to supply our values in s.i. units, like all parameters in STEPS::

    >>> R_bind_IP3_f.setKcst(1000e6)
    >>> R_bind_IP3_b.setKcst(25800)
    >>> RIP3_bind_Ca_f.setKcst(8000e6)
    >>> RIP3_bind_Ca_b.setKcst(2000)
    >>> R_bind_Ca_f.setKcst(8.889e6)
    >>> R_bind_Ca_b.setKcst(5)
    >>> RCa_bind_Ca_f.setKcst(20e6)
    >>> RCa_bind_Ca_b.setKcst(10)
    >>> R2Ca_bind_Ca_f.setKcst(40e6)
    >>> R2Ca_bind_Ca_b.setKcst(15)
    >>> R3Ca_bind_Ca_f.setKcst(60e6)
    >>> R3Ca_bind_Ca_b.setKcst(20)
    >>> R_Ca_channel_f.setKcst(2e8)
    
Geometry specification
======================

The next step is to create the geometry for the model. We will chose well-mixed 
geometry, as in [sub:well-mixed geom], but we now have two compartments which 
are connected by a surface patch. We create two :class:`steps.geom.Comp` objects 
to represent the Endoplasmic Reticulum (which we intend to label the 'inner' 
compartment) and the cytosol ('outer' compartment), and a :class:`steps.geom.Patch` 
object to represent the ER membrane between the ER and cytosol. 
We then add the stoichiometry we previously defined and grouped in our 
Surfsys object to the Patch object [#f4]_.

First we create the two well-mixed compartments. With more than one compartment 
in the model we must make sure that the identifier strings are be unique amongst
all compartments in the geometry container. We create the cytosol compartment 
with the minimum information (identifier string and reference to container), 
setting the volume with class method setVol, but set the volume of the ER during 
object construction purely to demonstrate the two possible ways to achieve the task::
    
    >>> import steps.geom as swm
    >>> wmgeom = swm.Geom()
    >>>
    >>> # Create the cytosol compartment
    >>> cyt = swm.Comp('cyt', wmgeom)					
    >>> cyt.setVol(1.6572e-19)
    >>>
    >>> # Create the Endoplasmic Reticulum compartment
    >>> ER = swm.Comp('ER', wmgeom, vol = 1.968e-20)
    
We now create a Patch object, defining the 'inner' and 'outer' compartments. 
We wish to label the ER as the 'inner' Comp and the cytosol as the 'outer' Comp, 
which we achieve by their order to the Patch object constructor. 
The 3rd (required) argument to the constructor is a reference to the 'inner' 
compartment and the 4th (optional) argument is a reference to the 'outer' 
compartment. It is vital that care is taken in the order to the constructor 
of the Comp objects, so that the required labelling from or Surface Reaction 
definitions is maintained [#f5]_.  We can check the labelling is as desired after 
object construction with methods ``getOComp`` and ``getIComp`` [#f6]_.

We also set the surface area of the patch::

    >>> # ER is the 'inner' compartment, cyt is the 'outer' compartment
    >>> memb = swm.Patch('memb', wmgeom, ER, cyt)		
    >>> memb.addSurfsys('ssys')
    >>> memb.setArea(0.4143e-12)
    >>> 
    >>> print 'Inner compartment to memb is', memb.getIComp().getID()
    Inner compartment to memb is ER
    >>> print 'Outer compartment to patch is', memb.getOComp().getID()
    Outer compartment to memb is cyt
    
Simulation with ``Wmdirect``
============================

Now the model is completed and ready for simulation. To run the simulation, 
we create a random number generator object, as we did previously in 
:doc:`/well_mixed`::
    
    >>> import steps.rng as srng
    >>> r = srng.create('mt19937', 512)
    >>> r.initialize(7233)
    
and use the ``Wmdirect`` solver as we also did::
    
    >>> import steps.solver as ssolver
    >>> sim = ssolver.Wmdirect(mdl, wmgeom, r)
    
To run the simulation and plot the data, we import modules from pylab and 
numpy and create arrays to store the data, as we also did previously. 
This time, however, we also want to plot the standard deviation so we 
create arrays to store that data too. Here we create variable ``NITER`` 
and assign it the value 100, the number of iterations we wish to run [#f7]_::

    >>> NITER = 100
    >>> import pylab
    >>> import numpy
    >>> tpnt = numpy.arange(0.0, 0.201, 0.001)
    >>> res = numpy.zeros([NITER, 201, 2]) 
    >>> res_std = numpy.zeros([201, 2])  
    >>> res_std1 = numpy.zeros([201, 2])
    >>> res_std2 = numpy.zeros([201, 2])
    
At the beginning of the simulation, we reset the solver state and set the 
initial concentration or count (by “count” we mean the number of molecules) 
of each species (any species we don't explicitly assign a concentration or 
count to will be initialized with the default value of zero which was set 
when we called the reset function) and run the simulation for NITER number 
of iterations. In the following example code, we record the number of IP3 
receptors in open state ('Ropen' in 'memb') and the concentration of calcium 
in the cytosol ('Ca' in 'cyt'). We include a pylab.plot call within our main 
loop to plot the number of open receptors for each individual iteration::

    >>> for i in xrange (0, NITER):
            sim.reset()
            sim.setCompConc('cyt', 'Ca', 3.30657e-8)               
            sim.setCompCount('cyt', 'IP3', 6)                   
            sim.setCompConc('ER', 'Ca', 150e-6)
            sim.setCompClamped('ER', 'Ca', True)
            sim.setPatchCount('memb', 'R', 160)	
            for t in xrange(0,201):
                sim.run(tpnt[t])
                res[i,t,0] = sim.getPatchCount('memb', 'Ropen')
                res[i,t,1] = sim.getCompConc('cyt', 'Ca')
            pylab.plot(tpnt, res[i,:,0], color = 'blue', linewidth = 0.1)
    >>>

We can also calculate the mean and standard deviation of our data using 
NumPy functions and plot in the same figure as our individual runs 
:ref:`Figure 3.3 <figure_3_3>`::

    >>> res_mean = numpy.mean(res, 0)
    >>> res_std = numpy.std(res, 0)
    >>> res_std1 = res_mean[:,0] + res_std[:,0]
    >>> res_std2 = res_mean[:,0]- res_std[:,0]
    >>>
    >>> pylab.plot(tpnt, res_mean[:,0], color = 'black', \
            linewidth = 2.0, label = 'mean')
    >>> pylab.plot(tpnt, res_std1, color = 'gray', \
        linewidth = 1.0, label='std')
    >>> pylab.plot(tpnt, res_std2,color = 'gray', linewidth = 1.0)
    >>>
    >>> pylab.xlabel('Time (sec)')
    >>> pylab.ylabel('# IP3 receptors in open state')
    >>> pylab.title('IP3 receptor model: %d iterations with Wmdirect'\
        %NITER)
    >>> pylab.ylim(0)
    >>> pylab.legend()
    >>> pylab.show()    

.. _figure_3_3:

   :height: 4.6in
   :width: 6in

   iterations, black trace shows the mean and gray trace shows the standard

.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#f1] Surface reactions are designed to represent reactions where one 
   reactant is embedded in a membrane, but in fact if all reactants and 
   products belong to the same compartment and none appear on a patch 
   it will behave exactly like the equivalent Reac object. 
.. [#f2] Reactant species cannot belong to different compartments, 
   so attempting to create an SReac object with both olhs and ``ilhs`` will 
   result in an error.
.. [#f3] Doi T, Kuroda S, Mishikawa T, Kawato M: Inositol 
   1,4,5-Triphosphate-Dependent :math:`Ca^{\text{2+}}` Threshold Dynamics

.. [#f4] Any volume-reactions we defined with Reac objects and grouped in Volsys 
   containers would be added to the Compartments at this stage.
.. [#f5] A Patch must have an inner compartment by convention, 
   but does not require an outer compartment. Obviously any surface reaction 
   rules that contain reactants or products in the outer compartment cannot be 
   added to such a Patch.
.. [#f6] Typically, get functions return references to the object, not the identifier 
   string, so we can use any of the object methods on the returned reference to 
   access information about the object. Here we use method getID, which returns 
   the identifier string of the object.
.. [#f7] It is perhaps better to group simulation parameters together at the 
   beginning of the script (such as number of iterations, simulation end time, 
   data collection time step, etc) so we can change a parameter simply by 
   changing one variable, which reduces the amount of typing and reduces the 
   scope for error. This is an approach we will adopt in the next chapter.
