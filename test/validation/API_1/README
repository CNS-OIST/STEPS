Run the STEPS validations. 4 folders are currently included:

validation_rd - Reaction-diffusion validation. Validated reaction and reaction-diffusion in solvers Wmdirect, Tetexact, and TetODE. See individual model files for more details. 

validation_efield - Validates the EField calculation in 3 tests, Rallpack 1 and 3 and a voltage-clamp test. Rallpack 3 is run with the determinsitic solver TetODE due to significant noise in the stochastic system. 

validation_mpi - not currently included in tests
validation_cp - Validation of checkpointing, also not currently included in tests. 


Serial validations are run in terminal by executing

    ctest -R python-validation-API_1

within the build directory (/build). Execution should take ~ 15 minutes for all current tests (those under validation_rd and validation_efield)

Parallel validations are run in terminal by executing

   ctest -R python-validation-parallel-API_1

within the build directory (/build).
