/*! \mainpage SuperLU_DIST Documentation
 
  SuperLU_DIST is a parallel library for the direct solution of large,
  sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations for distributed
  memory machines. The library is written in C and MPI, and is callable
  from either C or Fortran. The library routines perform an LU
  decomposition with static pivoting and triangular system solutions
  through forward and back substitution.
