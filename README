PACKAGE CONTENTS
================

doc/
    Documentation.

extras/
    Extra stuff. Not too much right now, to be honest.

steps/
    The main source code is located here. This directory is largely
    organized as Python packages, but not everywhere. C++ implementation
    and header files are mixed along with Python modules and SWIG
    interface files.

thirdparty/
    Things which have been contributed by users but are not a part of
    the core functionality STEPS.
