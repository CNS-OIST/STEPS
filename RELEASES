Release Notes

Version 1.0.0 (2010-01-05)
==========================
First release.

Version 1.0.1 (2010-01-28)
==========================
1. Bug fix of utilities.meshio.importTetgen() method crashing.
2. Changes to 'def' classes so that these classes no longer store
   a pointer to model level objects or access data from those objects, 
   instead coping all data during construction and setup. 
   Also modified rng.py to be directly created by swig for 
   compatability with python3.
   
Version 1.1.0 (2010-03-20)
==========================
1. Replace GNU distrubution system with Python Distutils.
2. Provide a visualization toolkit for mesh based simulation 
    (steps.utilitis.visual)
3. Provide checkpointing support for Wmdirect and Tetexact solvers.
    (Please check user manual for more details)
4. New user manual and API reference
    
Version 1.1.1 (2010-04-7)
==========================
1. New setup.py to fix undefined symbol error in Linux
2. function name fix in utilities/visual.py
    
Version 1.1.2 (2010-05-8)
==========================
1. Solve crash problem of Tetexact solver in some Linux system.
Binary packages of version 1.1.1 are not affected, 
so only source package is released.

Version 1.2.0 (2011-04-)
==========================
1. SBML support in steps/utilities/sbml.py
2. Addition of Diffusion Boundary object, which allows for optional 
chemical diffusion between connected compartments.  
3. Initial conditions improvement for Tetexact solver, resulting
in a  uniform initial spatial concentration across the 
compartment (or patch) regardless of tetrahedron volumes (or triangle 
areas), important where tetrahedrons vary considerably in volume. 
Thanks to Haroon Anwar for bringing this issue to our attention.
4. Bugfix on Wmrk4 deterministic solver on the reset() function, 
which previously did not reset counts in Patches. 
5. Changed zero-order reaction constants to the conventional M/s. 
Previously was /s.
6. Bugifx on surface-reactions. Now reaction constants for reactions 
that involve reactants only on a patch (nothing in a volume) are 
correctly scaled in 2D, as opposed to previous 3D scaling. Thanks 
to Gabriela Antunes for pointing out this one. 
7. Additions to examples folder to include scripts that link to the 
user documentation, found in examples/tutorial.
